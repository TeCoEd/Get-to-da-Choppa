# Get-to-da-Choppa
Arnie is caught up inside a book, can you help him out?

I asked my Raspberry Pi club what they wanted to create and they said a book that talks to you.  Not in the conventional way of reading to you, but in a way to get your attention, to call you over and shout at you.  Even better if the book was Arnold Schwarzenegger's autobiography and he tells you to get you to 'get to the chopper now!'
